##### In EfficientNet, rethinking all scaling of CNN to prove the accuracy and the efficiency.

##### Compound Model Scaling: A Better Way to Scale Up CNNs
In order to understand the effect of scaling the network, It is important to study the impact of scaling different dimensions of the model.

The first compound scaling method is to perform a grid search to find the relationship between different scaling dimensions of the baseline network under a fixed resource constraint.
This determines the appropriate scaling coefficient for each of the dimensions mentioned above.

##### Problem Formulation
Maximize the model accuracy for any given resource constraints, which can be formulated as an optimization problem.

_w, d, r_ are coefficients for scaling network width, depth, and resolution.

> __Observation 1__ : Scaling up any dimension of network width, depth, or resolution improves accuracy, but the accuracy gain diminishes for bigger models.

##### Compound Scaling Method
Different scaling dimensions are not independent. For higher resolution images, should be increased network depth. So increase the network width when resolution is higher

New compound scaling method uses a compound coefficient _Ï†_ to uniformly scales network width, depth, and resolution in a principled way.

> __Observation 2__ : In order to pursue better accuracy and efficiency, it is critical to balance all dimensions of network width, depth, and resolution during ConvNet scaling.

##### EfficientNet Architecture

EfficientNet architecture uses mobile inverted bottleneck convolution(MBConv). It is similar to MobileNetV2 and MnasNet, but it is slightly larger due to an increased FLOP budget.
